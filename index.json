In this project, we developed a method of visually communicating navigation instructions using translational and rotational arrow cues (TRAC) defined in an objectcentric frame, while displaying a single principal view that approximates the human’s egocentric view of the physical object. We found that subjects can achieve 1 mm and 1 degree accuracy using the TRAC method with a median completion time of less than 20 seconds.\nThis software work has been patented, and the work was presented at the 2018 Hamlyn Symposium on Medical Robotics in London, and in ACM Transactions on Applied Perception.\nWe hope to release a software package for this project soon.\n","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"f9e19651dbeb34c62a7c4482bd617f9f","permalink":"https://dusevitch.github.io/project/trac/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/trac/","section":"project","summary":"Custom tool navigation software for surgical applications","tags":["software"],"title":"Translational and Rotational Arrow Cues (TRAC) Navigation Method for Manual Alignment Tasks","type":"project"},{"authors":["David E.

We are interested in the optimal guidance of a microrobot swarm from an initial state to a final goal state using an array of eight electromagnets generating magnetic dipole fields. We compare the convergence, computation complexity, and time-to-target time for moving the microrobots to the correct configuration using two different methods of guidance previously suggested. The first method guides the centroid and spread or deviation of the swarm to a final centroid location and spread. The second method divides the workspace into voxels and guides the microrobots from the initial voxel density state to a final goal voxel density. Both methods yield comparable restuls, however the voxel method outperforms the centroid method in terms of convergence.\n","date":1544832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544832000,"objectID":"bc718008eacee85c2897bc4d9e78b1dd","permalink":"https://dusevitch.github.io/project/microrobot_swarm/","publishdate":"2018-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/microrobot_swarm/","section":"project","summary":"Virtually modelling of omnimagnets to test 2 methods for controlling microrobot swarms in 3D space","tags":["surgical_robotics"],"title":"Magnetic Manipulation of Microrobot Swarms","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"During eye surgery, the patient’s head moves due to natural processes such as breathing and snoring, and the surgeon must compensate for this movement to the best of their ability. However, such movement limits the precision of the surgeon and thus the difficulty of the procedures that can be accomplished. A variety of robotic systems are being developed to improve surgical precision, and these systems will also need to address this patient movement. However, very little quantitative data is currently available regarding patient head movement during eye surgery.

The purpose of this research is to develop a viable variable-stiffness compliant joint for haptic interfaces that eliminate rotation joints or screw mechanisms that induce friction, increase weight and cost, and make devices more complex and prone to failure. The resulting compliant haptic device was designed with both affordability and dependability in mind, and hopes to result in research knowledge leading to realistic touch experiences as users interact with virtual or remote environments. The joint may also be applicable in other common future applications such as robotic arms and legs, rehabilitation robots, and haptic educational tools.\nModel 3 showed the most promise according to FEA output, combining ease of manufacturing and proof of haptic feedback. It was created using a triangular meshing technique with 2560 nodes. There was an 8 N increase of the resultant force when the device was compared with an arm movement at rest to an arm movement of 1.27 cm (0.5 in) when it’s lower legs were displaced by 2 cm. This model was selected for the physical testing.\nTests for the fixture was performed by compressing the lower arms of the device together at intervals of 4, 3.5, and 3 in. This was to mimic the same motion as might occur if the legs were attached to a spinning motor, solenoid, etc. The main arm was then moved until the top point was displaced horizontally by 0.5 in. The force for physical displacement was then recorded and results can be seen in the figure below. Additional iterations were performed, but not included in this report. We are able to see that the physical device saw an overall 5.8 N resultant force increase between the positions tested.\n","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"1bcde8c0cba8d5f1ed503fcf1fa19389","permalink":"https://dusevitch.github.io/project/compliant_paddle/","publishdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/compliant_paddle/","section":"project","summary":"A custom-designed and jointless compliant mechanism demonstrated the ability to represent haptic forces.
